# Villager Befriending
## Why?
Have you ever wanted to easily transport villagers?
<br />
What about making them stay in one place without any tricks?
<br />
~~Or just have a lovely time chilling with a friend~~ *jk that won't happen*.

Well want no more because with this mod you can do **just that**!

## But how?
To *befriend* a villager, you will need to make yourself a ``Totem of Friendship``.
<br />

<br />
After you have made a ``Totem of Friendship`` you need to get the ``Hero of the Village`` effect by defeating a raid.
<br />
Now you can finally give the ``Totem of Friendship`` to a villager by *throwing* it in front of them.

After doing all that, the villager is now your friend, and you can tell them to ``Stay Here``, ``Follow Me``, or ``Wander Around`` by just *shift* + *right-clicking* them.
